The spa only offers the ""Red Carpet Signature"" manicure out of all written options listed. It costs 699 rs, after tax 824 rs. This is almost how much it costs in a lower-end New York City salon, but the quality is absolutely abysmal. They massage your hands and lower arms and put a nice scrub on it, but the *actual* painting of the nails looks like a 5 year old tried to do it. It was so bad, I immediately went up to my room to write this review, even if it ruins my nails further. No offense to the workers there, but it's like no one has trained them how to do a proper manicure. They only put 1 layer of color, which makes it looks cheap and tacky and not strong enough to last, and also look smudged. And there isn't any clear nail polish layer to make the color last...this is BASIC stuff! And obviously, no OPI or good brands here. Nor are there facilities to dry nails...so cheap!https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d10819593-Reviews-or40-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Vivanta_By_Taj_Hotel-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telanga.html",1.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d10819593-Reviews-or40-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Vivanta_By_Taj_Hotel-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telanga.html

59,59,Worst possible experience even before going for the service!!!https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Really disappointed with my experience with 02 spa, both at the call centre level as well as with the front desk. This is my first time trying 02 and had called on 8th October to a call center number (9032150202) listed on Google maps and a male picked up and did the cursory asking of questions on the date preferred and time. We settled with 12th October for 11:30 am. We arrive at the location by 11:10 am and the lady at the front desk Maya attends to us, asking us for what we wanted. We were 2 of us as mentioned in the appointment and she immediately said, there was no place today and they were totally booked. We were a little taken aback as she had not asked us for our names or phone number and assumed that we would not be the ones who had blocked the time. She then spoke to someone and we could hear only one side of the conversation, where she said there were only 3 staff and they could not take any more appointments. We were not offered any seat or any semblance of hospitality!!! We went out and called another number (9247020202) and this time a man called Naman picked up the phone! He strangely was able to see open slots at the same location for the same time! So we went back in with him on the line, and asked him to speak to her and she still said, it was not possible to accommodate us. So, Naman calls the other number that has the same time as what ours was supposed to be and tells me that they intend to come in and so ours stands cancelled as it is not showing on their system. He then asks us, if we would like to pick another time and day and we go on with 14th October. He is trying to fix me with an o2 location in Novotel Kondapur. As we were discussing this, he tells me that it is confirmed and I tell him that i refuse to believe a verbal confirmation as that is excatly what happened on Thursday and I had to endure all this today! He then has the audacity to ask me to ""drop my sarcasm"" and i repeat his words verbatim. Needless to say, i was furious that he has the audacity to lecture me on my tone!!!! That the lady Maya at the front desk who is supposed to recieve guests and make them comfortable has zero etiquette is not to worried about, that my experience at being treated so shabbily by her and hence the sarcasm in my tone is the bone of contention. He goes on to tell me that this conversation is going nowehere unless i drop my sarcasm and that he is showing me empathy by arranging another appointment for me because his company's software has double booked and thrown me out!!! He hangs up saying that he will not give me an appointment with my attitude!!!!One of the keys asks is decorum when one is in the business of hospitality!

61,61,Most stressful Spa experience everhttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Had gifted my sister an O2 spa gift card for her birthday, and visited the Jubilee Hills branch this weekend. And everything about the visit just went wrong:1. They ask you to come 15mins early, we ended up reaching almost half an hour early, and were very happy to hear that they could start our service immediately. This was my sister's first visit, so had booked a couple room. After waiting for 40mins, we were finally told there was no couple room available, and hence the delay. We asked for individual rooms and were led our separate ways. Throughout this wait time, we could hear the employees chatting and laughing and shouting loudly inside the spa - felt like I was in a local beauty parlour, not a relaxing spa. Minus points on the ambience.2. They led me to the first floor, and told me there's some construction going on, but the room will be fine. It wasn't. Firstly, because it faced the road, there was crazy amount of construction noise. And noise of water leaking from the attached washroom. The curtains were translucent at best, and not fully drawn. The therapist just handed me a disposable underwear and went away with zero instructions of how i should cover myself to wait for her. I also couldnt understand why I needed to strip down for a neck + foot massage, and tried to call out to her. But when I opened the door, all I found were construction workers outside. I had to shout at the top of my lungs to get any employee's attention, who then went and found her. This is when I find out that the therapist was preparing me for a full body massage - when I asked her about it, she shrugged and said ""Kya pata, management theek se nahin batate (Don't know, the management doesn't tell us properly."" She then left, and a completely new person entered the room for the massage. 3. Throughout the massage all I could hear was traffic, employees chatting and shouting, and construction workers outside my room. The bed on which I was lying down was completely dirty at the bottom - which is what I was staring at throughout, and didn't make me feel very hygienic. Eventually i cut it short and decided to not go ahead withe foot massage - they didn't have any pyjamas / disposable clothes for it anyway, and I didn't feel like stripping down for it. Moreover, the massage itself was average, I've had much better experiences at a lower price point. I informed the management about all the issues, and their main response was, we told you there's construction. I told them that given I'm paying full price, and wasn't informed on the phone while taking an appointment, that is no reason for my spa experience to be loud and horrible. I had to again push them to ask their employees to be quieter, at which point the receptionist went in and shouted at the employees to be quiet.4. While my sister had a much better experience (a room away from the construction and noise) - she too faced confusion about which service she had asked for, and was eventually given a robe to wear with no belt, so she couldn't actually shut it. When she enquired about it, the therapist shrugged and said things have been going missing recently, and she has no clue where the belt might be.Overall a super disappointing and stressful experience - at a premium location and spa. In all of this they were trying to sell their membership to us - definitely not taking that, or recommending this place to anyone.Also their feedback link doesn't work properly - so was forced to give a public review.https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",1.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html

Firstly, it's very, very run down inside. It's pretty disgusting and not at all peaceful. My pedicurist has clearly never had training in her job. The spa brochure advertised 30 minutes for the pedicure but she took 1.5 hours and didn't even do it properly. She was very slow and it took her 3 tries to trim my nails properly. She scrubbed my feet so hard with SOAP on a hard brush (this is never a spa practice) my feet were dry and very sore afterwards. When I insisted she start painting my nails, and I picked a color, she started but the bottle was so dried out she has a hard time painting and tried to use another color halfway through. She only did one coat and just left me sitting. I had to ask her to do a second coat. There was polish all over my skin, it looked like a child did it. The second coat was not much better. No top coat, fine. I was disgusted with her lack of professionalism and wanted to get out as fast as possible. I told the front desk what happened and they said I could come back but the spa was so filthy I am worried that they do not clean materials properly and I could get an infection. This spa should be shut down immediately. The staff need training at the very least. A woman across from me was having her nails done as well. She saw what was happening and she told me the spa here is so bad at painting she just has them shape her nails and she paints them on her own.

One goes to the spa to relax ,this spa has a Starbucks spa next to it and because of the proximity , the noise levels are very high . Trying to relax in the spa is next to impossible , as we can listen to orders being placed , conversations taking place , loud laughter  and music being played , cell phone conversations of the patrons from the  Starbucks tables ,in addition to the noise from Starbucks , even the masseurs converse and go about talking ,walking loudly spoiling the so called spa experience .The air conditioning is non existent and massage chairs placed so close to each other that it is claustrophobic .The masseurs  technique is poor and ineffective.  I changed my masseur once but the second one was equally ineffective.They seem to have no sort of professional training and just go about pressing here ,there and everywhere without any idea what to do . The only prior experience I feel is that they have had before is maybe pressing  the feet of mom / dad or mother in law at home .Guys , seriously avoid this spa like plague It’s nothing but a scam .https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g304551-d6696914-Reviews-O2_Spa-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html",1.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g304551-d6696914-Reviews-O2_Spa-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html

The spa only offers the ""Red Carpet Signature"" manicure out of all written options listed. It costs 699 rs, after tax 824 rs. This is almost how much it costs in a lower-end New York City salon, but the quality is absolutely abysmal. They massage your hands and lower arms and put a nice scrub on it, but the *actual* painting of the nails looks like a 5 year old tried to do it. It was so bad, I immediately went up to my room to write this review, even if it ruins my nails further. No offense to the workers there, but it's like no one has trained them how to do a proper manicure. They only put 1 layer of color, which makes it looks cheap and tacky and not strong enough to last, and also look smudged. And there isn't any clear nail polish layer to make the color last...this is BASIC stuff! And obviously, no OPI or good brands here.

60,60,Worst possible experience even before going for the service!!!https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Really disappointed with my experience with 02 spa, both at the call centre level as well as with the front desk. This is my first time trying 02 and had called on 8th October to a call center number (9032150202) listed on Google maps and a male picked up and did the cursory asking of questions on the date preferred and time. We settled with 12th October for 11:30 am. We arrive at the location by 11:10 am and the lady at the front desk Maya attends to us, asking us for what we wanted. We were 2 of us as mentioned in the appointment and she immediately said, there was no place today and they were totally booked. We were a little taken aback as she had not asked us for our names or phone number and assumed that we would not be the ones who had blocked the time. She then spoke to someone and we could hear only one side of the conversation, where she said there were only 3 staff and they could not take any more appointments. We were not offered any seat or any semblance of hospitality!!! We went out and called another number (9247020202) and this time a man called Naman picked up the phone! He strangely was able to see open slots at the same location for the same time! So we went back in with him on the line, and asked him to speak to her and she still said, it was not possible to accommodate us. So, Naman calls the other number that has the same time as what ours was supposed to be and tells me that they intend to come in and so ours stands cancelled as it is not showing on their system. He then asks us, if we would like to pick another time and day and we go on with 14th October. He is trying to fix me with an o2 location in Novotel Kondapur. As we were discussing this, he tells me that it is confirmed and I tell him that i refuse to believe a verbal confirmation as that is excatly what happened on Thursday and I had to endure all this today! He then has the audacity to ask me to ""drop my sarcasm"" and i repeat his words verbatim. Needless to say, i was furious that he has the audacity to lecture me on my tone!!!! That the lady Maya at the front desk who is supposed to recieve guests and make them comfortable has zero etiquette is not to worried about, that my experience at being treated so shabbily by her and hence the sarcasm in my tone is the bone of contention. He goes on to tell me that this conversation is going nowehere unless i drop my sarcasm and that he is showing me empathy by arranging another appointment for me because his company's software has double booked and thrown me out!!! He hangs up saying that he will not give me an appointment with my attitude!!!!One of the keys asks is decorum when one is in the business of hospitality! I was appalled at the lack of decorum and basic courtesy that one would extend to even a stranger who visits the house! o2 needs to work heavily on training their staff with basic etiquettehttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",1.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html

62,62,Most stressful Spa experience everhttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html,"Had gifted my sister an O2 spa gift card for her birthday, and visited the Jubilee Hills branch this weekend. And everything about the visit just went wrong:1. They ask you to come 15mins early, we ended up reaching almost half an hour early, and were very happy to hear that they could start our service immediately. This was my sister's first visit, so had booked a couple room. After waiting for 40mins, we were finally told there was no couple room available, and hence the delay. We asked for individual rooms and were led our separate ways. Throughout this wait time, we could hear the employees chatting and laughing and shouting loudly inside the spa - felt like I was in a local beauty parlour, not a relaxing spa. Minus points on the ambience.2. They led me to the first floor, and told me there's some construction going on, but the room will be fine. It wasn't. Firstly, because it faced the road, there was crazy amount of construction noise. And noise of water leaking from the attached washroom. The curtains were translucent at best, and not fully drawn. The therapist just handed me a disposable underwear and went away with zero instructions of how i should cover myself to wait for her. I also couldnt understand why I needed to strip down for a neck + foot massage, and tried to call out to her. But when I opened the door, all I found were construction workers outside. I had to shout at the top of my lungs to get any employee's attention, who then went and found her. This is when I find out that the therapist was preparing me for a full body massage - when I asked her about it, she shrugged and said ""Kya pata, management theek se nahin batate (Don't know, the management doesn't tell us properly."" She then left, and a completely new person entered the room for the massage. 3. Throughout the massage all I could hear was traffic, employees chatting and shouting, and construction workers outside my room. The bed on which I was lying down was completely dirty at the bottom - which is what I was staring at throughout, and didn't make me feel very hygienic. Eventually i cut it short and decided to not go ahead withe foot massage - they didn't have any pyjamas / disposable clothes for it anyway, and I didn't feel like stripping down for it. Moreover, the massage itself was average, I've had much better experiences at a lower price point. I informed the management about all the issues, and their main response was, we told you there's construction. I told them that given I'm paying full price, and wasn't informed on the phone while taking an appointment, that is no reason for my spa experience to be loud and horrible. I had to again push them to ask their employees to be quieter, at which point the receptionist went in and shouted at the employees to be quiet.4. While my sister had a much better experience (a room away from the construction and noise) - she too faced confusion about which service she had asked for, and was eventually given a robe to wear with no belt, so she couldn't actually shut it. When she enquired about it, the therapist shrugged and said things have been going missing recently, and she has no clue where the belt might be.Overall a super disappointing and stressful experience - at a premium location and spa. In all of this they were trying to sell their membership to us - definitely not taking that, or recommending this place to anyone.Also their feedback link doesn't work properly - so was forced to give a public review.https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html",1.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297586-d8321863-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Hyderabad_Jubilee_Hills-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html

If the same reason were given to me when I had called her I would have not confirmed the Spa Appointment in the first place.When i said the way she is communicating is rude she just asked me only one question were you not explained about the Happy Hours membership??Firstly it was not a planed visit. Secondly once I call the Spa they have all the details reflecting on there system. It's not about the discount or about the rush in which I was asked to come to the spa.It's about the way you communicate to the customer.

I went their to get relax. The worst service ever , i will never suggest anyone to go over there. Being in a hotel like Marriott Ahmadabad i didn't expect this type of service in a 5 star hotel and when asked to the therapist which oil you are using she didn't answer and when I smelled it it was like cooking oil. Do we pay to get massage in a cooking oil. Above that the quality of towel and bed sheet was very bad it was smelling like anything.

139,139,Horrible spa https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d3488112-Reviews-or50-Ode_SPA_Courtyard_by_Marriott_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html,"I was surprised to see this is the top rated spa in Ahmedabad as it is truly awful. Firstly, it's very, very run down inside. It's pretty disgusting and not at all peaceful. My pedicurist has clearly never had training in her job. The spa brochure advertised 30 minutes for the pedicure but she took 1.5 hours and didn't even do it properly. She was very slow and it took her 3 tries to trim my nails properly. She scrubbed my feet so hard with SOAP on a hard brush (this is never a spa practice) my feet were dry and very sore afterwards. When I insisted she start painting my nails, and I picked a color, she started but the bottle was so dried out she has a hard time painting and tried to use another color halfway through. She only did one coat and just left me sitting. I had to ask her to do a second coat. There was polish all over my skin, it looked like a child did it. The second coat was not much better. No top coat, fine. I was disgusted with her lack of professionalism and wanted to get out as fast as possible. I told the front desk what happened and they said I could come back but the spa was so filthy I am worried that they do not clean materials properly and I could get an infection. This spa should be shut down immediately. The staff need training at the very least. A woman across from me was having her nails done as well. She saw what was happening and she told me the spa here is so bad at painting she just has them shape her nails and she paints them on her own. Yikes. https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d3488112-Reviews-or50-Ode_SPA_Courtyard_by_Marriott_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",1.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d3488112-Reviews-or50-Ode_SPA_Courtyard_by_Marriott_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d3488112-Reviews-or50-Ode_SPA_Courtyard_by_Marriott_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html

When I asked for the complimentary cup of tea from my therapist, she neither listened nor did I receive my tea. The massages provided are not good. I started to feel dizzy after my session. Not a good sign.Their Salon services are appalling. They don't even know how to properly cut and file nails!!!Diffused lighting makes any salon related therapy tedious and inefficient. The equipment provided to them is sub-standard. And the therapists have to lug heavy copper bowls filled with hot water (that quickly turns cold) to and fro from the tiny massage rooms. They are not big on hygiene or peace.Not a good spa experience at all.https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d10821970-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Novotel_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html",2.0 of 5 bubbleshttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d10821970-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Novotel_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g297608-d10821970-Reviews-or10-Ode_Spa_Novotel_Ahmedabad-Ahmedabad_Ahmedabad_District_Gujarat.html

I changed my masseur once but the second one was equally ineffective.They seem to have no sort of professional training and just go about pressing here ,there and everywhere without any idea what to do .
